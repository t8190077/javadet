The system creates a data.txt file if it does not exist but we will provide you with a data.txt file with inserted patients in order for you to see the programmes capabilities without having to insert patients first.

Keep the covidtracelogo.png in the same directory as the Covidtrace.jar file.


##  Description
CovidTrace is an easy-to-use application which can help hospitals manage their patients and also choose the best patients to vaccinate first, based on network science measures such as node degree.
As a hospital manager you can insert the patients that stay in ICUs(Intensive Care Units). You can manage the patients data, get a live statistical overview of the database and insert the people that each patient has been in contact with. Then with the jupyter notebook file you can see the live network of the disease spreading, and can make decisions on the line of vaccinations.

## Visuals
We have created an application that is easy-to-use while producing critical information. You are given a display, with buttons that correspond to commands. In the command textfield you can write the patients name in order to search or delete him. All errors and messages will be displayed in the display area, a custom terminal build for our program. In the jupyter notebook, all you need to do is run the whole file and at the end of the code blocks you will be able to see the patients network.

## Installation 

 Compiled with Java version 13.0.1
 To install the dependencies needed to run the jupyter notebook for mac os/linux type the following commands in your terminal:
 
 
 pip install matplotlib
 pip install pandas

To run the notebook type:
